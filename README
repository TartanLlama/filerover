
Using FileRover

First:
    Extract all files and navigate to their location in the unix terminal or
    command prompt.


Server:
    To run, start "serverio.py" in the python environment.
    
    To run the server using a specific file space, supply the desired directory
    as a parameter at the command line. e.g. "python serverio.py filepath".
    
    The default file space is the directory the program is running in.


Client:
    To use the client, start "filerover.py" in the python environment, You will
    be presented with a graphical user interface.
    
    From here, you may connect to a server at a specific address by typing the
    address in the address field and clicking connect, or by choosing to "Show
    Servers", then double-clicking a server from the list which appears. To
    disconnect, click "Disconnect".
    
    Files on the local machine may be browsed using the panel on the left, and
    files on the remote machine may be browsed on the right.
    
    To go into a directory or view a file as text (known problem: this fails on
    very big files), double-click on the directory or file. To go up to the
    parent directory, click "Back".
    
    To upload or download a file, select the file on the appropriate side of
    the window and click "Upload" or "Download". The progress bar at the bottom
    of the screen will show you the percentage complete, and transfers will run
    one after the other.
    
    To refresh and update the list of items in the current directory on the
    client and server sides, click the "Refresh" button.
    
    To make a new directory, type the directory name into the command bar (the
    one below the "Connect" and "Refresh" buttons), and click "Make Dir" on the
    client or server side.

Thankyou for using FileRover!
